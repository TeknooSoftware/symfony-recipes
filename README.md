Teknoo Software - Symfony Recipes
=================================

Repository hosting Symfony Flex Recipes dedicated to help to use Teknoo Software's libraries with Symfony 6.0 and later.

To enable these recipes in your project, you must add in your `composer.json` the entry 
`https://api.github.com/repos/TeknooSoftware/symfony-recipes/contents/index.json` to the list `extra.symfony.endpoint`
and set to `true` the entry `extra.symfony.allow-contrib`.

If the `extra.symfony.endpoint` is not already defined, you must also add `flex://defaults` to avoid errors.
